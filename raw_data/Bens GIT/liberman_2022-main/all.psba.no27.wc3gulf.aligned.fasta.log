Host:    sequana (AVX2, FMA3, 944 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s all.psba.no27.wc3gulf.aligned.fasta -B 1000 -m TVMe+R4
Seed:    50692 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jul 21 10:31:23 2022
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (256 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 256 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
